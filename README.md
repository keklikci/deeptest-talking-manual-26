# Benchmarking the Talking Owner's Manual (DeepTest Workshop Competition 26')
<p align="center"><img src="figures/teaser.png" alt="teaser" width="40%"></p>

## Overview ##

The automotive domain increasingly adopts large language model (LLM)-based assistants to help drivers access information from vehicle owner manuals more efficiently [1,2]. For example, a driver may request instructions for enabling Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC). Many functions, such as for instance ACC, require specific environmental or driver-related preconditions, such as adequate sensor visibility in adverse weather to ensure safe operation. 

Manuals communicate these constraints through warning statements. An LLM-based assistant should therefore also provide such warnings if required. However, because LLMs may hallucinate, there is a risk that essential warnings are omitted or stated incorrectly. The objective of this competition is to find an automated way of stress-testing an LLM-based automotive assistant with respect to its reliability in propagating accurate safety-related information when necessary.

The competitors should propose an *automated* test generator that produces textual inputs (user requests) to test the information system.  The aim of the generation is to produce diverse failure-inducing tests, i.e., request that make the system ignore a warning in the response.An example of an executed (non-failing) test and system architecture is provided below.

The ranking of the tools is based on different metrics, including the number of diverse warnings ignored and the diversity of generated test inputs to support better root cause analysis. 

The generated user requests are evaluated on a public simplified RAG-based information system and on an industrial research prototype provided by [BMW Group](https://www.bmwgroup.com/).

## Registration

To register for the competition, please send us your **Name**, **Affiliation & Address** to the following address: [lev.sorokin@tum.de](mailto:lev.sorokin@tum.de?subject=DeepTest%20Competition%20-%20Talking%20Manual). Use as email subject "DeepTest Competition - Talking Manual".

The registration is open until: *30-11-2025*.

Please note that the number of available spots is limited. Participants will receive a confirmation email along with further instructions and access to the competition code. Registration will be accepted on a first-come, first-served basis.

The competition is organized in the context of the DeepTest Workshop, co-located with the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2026). Participants will present their approach and results at the workshop, either in person or remotely.
Information about the workshop is available at: https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2026/deeptest-2026

## Implement Your Test Generator ##

We provide a code pipeline that will integrate your test generator with the system-under-test by validating, executing and evaluating your test cases. Moreover, we offer sample test generators to show how to use the code pipeline.
For the execution of the pipeline there is no GPU-based computation needed. Access to cloud-based LLMs will be granted.

Consider following constraints for the generated requests:

- Input should be based on english vocabulary.
- Input should be less then a fixed number of words.

For the test generation you receive manual artefacts and an extracted list of warnings in the [data folder](data/).

An extracted list of warnings and corresponding sections/components can be found in [warnings.csv](data/warnings.csv).
Please, not that the extracted list might be not complete why it might be worth to inspect the manual artifacts directly.

Detailed guidelines for the competition are available in [GUIDELINES](documentation/GUIDELINES.md).

Installation instructions of how to use the code can be found in [INSTALLATION](documentation/INSTALLATION.md).


## Comparing the Test Generators ##

Published methodology and benchmark context are collected in
[Competition results and research context](documentation/RESULTS_AND_RESEARCH_CONTEXT.md).

## Exida test generator

The submitted Exida generator targets warnings that an automotive manual assistant
should mention when answering a request. For each selected warning it creates a
temporary, concrete driving scene, extracts the action the driver is considering,
and turns that intent into a short natural-language question. The scene and intent
are intermediate context; only the final question is returned to the system under
test.

Exida asks the language model for a batch of question candidates and keeps the first
candidate whose word-set Jaccard similarity is not greater than the configured
threshold for any recent question. This gives the generator a small diversity filter
without requiring embeddings or access to the system under test. When the oracle
reports an ignored warning (score below `0.5`), Exida adds another copy of that
warning to its sampling pool for future tests.

The implementation and its offline unit tests are described in
[the Exida methodology guide](documentation/EXIDA_METHODOLOGY.md). The tests mock
LLM calls, so they do not require credentials, network access, or downloaded models.

Deciding which test generator is the best is far from trivial and, currently, remains an open challenge. 
We use multiple metrics to rank the test generators. The first set of metrics which is available to participants is:

- (num diverse warnings) Number of diverse warnings ignored.
- (num warnings) Number of warnings ignored.
- (embedding diversity) Avg max embedding distance between generated requests.
- (time) Time to the first warning ignored.

The second metric is applied by the jurors and relies on clustering techniques to measure the diversity of failure-inducing test cases. The more clusters are covered the more diverse are the failure types.
As we expect that submitted tools are stochastic in nature, metrics are computed over several runs of the corresponding test generator.

We combine all metrics results into a single score to rank the results.
