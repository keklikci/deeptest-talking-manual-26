# Exida: Stress-Testing the Talking Owner's Manual
<p align="center"><img src="figures/teaser.png" alt="teaser" width="40%"></p>

Exida is the submitted test generator for the DeepTest 2026 competition. It
finished **second overall** and exposed warning omissions in **57% of generated
requests** in the competition benchmark. In the controlled evaluation reported
in the Exida methodology paper, it reached a **0.656 failure rate** and **0.905
normalized diversity** with a fixed budget of 100 generated tests. These figures
come from the [Exida methodology paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3786154.3796501)
and the [competition results paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3786154.3796504).

## How Exida works

Exida turns a manual warning into a natural driver question through three
stages:

1. It selects a safety warning and generates a concrete scene around its
   circumstances, such as weather, destination, and time pressure.
2. It extracts the driver's intended action from that scene.
3. It generates several concise questions, rejects ones too similar to recent
   requests using word-set Jaccard similarity, and sends the first diverse
   candidate to the system under test.

When the oracle detects that a warning was omitted, Exida increases that
warning's sampling probability. This feedback loop concentrates testing on
weak spots while the recent-question filter preserves surface diversity. The
scene and intent are temporary scaffolding: only the final question is sent to
the assistant.

## Overview ##

The automotive domain increasingly adopts large language model (LLM)-based assistants to help drivers access information from vehicle owner manuals more efficiently [1,2]. For example, a driver may request instructions for enabling Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC). Many functions, such as for instance ACC, require specific environmental or driver-related preconditions, such as adequate sensor visibility in adverse weather to ensure safe operation. 

Manuals communicate these constraints through warning statements. An LLM-based assistant should therefore also provide such warnings if required. However, because LLMs may hallucinate, there is a risk that essential warnings are omitted or stated incorrectly. The objective of this competition is to find an automated way of stress-testing an LLM-based automotive assistant with respect to its reliability in propagating accurate safety-related information when necessary.

The competitors should propose an *automated* test generator that produces textual inputs (user requests) to test the information system.  The aim of the generation is to produce diverse failure-inducing tests, i.e., request that make the system ignore a warning in the response.An example of an executed (non-failing) test and system architecture is provided below.

The ranking of the tools is based on different metrics, including the number of diverse warnings ignored and the diversity of generated test inputs to support better root cause analysis. 

The generated user requests are evaluated on a public simplified RAG-based information system and on an industrial research prototype provided by [BMW Group](https://www.bmwgroup.com/).

## Competition

To register for the competition, please send us your **Name**, **Affiliation & Address** to the following address: [lev.sorokin@tum.de](mailto:lev.sorokin@tum.de?subject=DeepTest%20Competition%20-%20Talking%20Manual). Use as email subject "DeepTest Competition - Talking Manual".

The registration is open until: *30-11-2025*.

Please note that the number of available spots is limited. Participants will receive a confirmation email along with further instructions and access to the competition code. Registration will be accepted on a first-come, first-served basis.

The competition is organized in the context of the DeepTest Workshop, co-located with the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2026). Participants will present their approach and results at the workshop, either in person or remotely.
Information about the workshop is available at: https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2026/deeptest-2026

## Implement Your Test Generator ##

We provide a code pipeline that will integrate your test generator with the system-under-test by validating, executing and evaluating your test cases. Moreover, we offer sample test generators to show how to use the code pipeline.
For the execution of the pipeline there is no GPU-based computation needed. Access to cloud-based LLMs will be granted.

Consider following constraints for the generated requests:

- Input should be based on english vocabulary.
- Input should be less then a fixed number of words.

For the test generation you receive manual artefacts and an extracted list of warnings in the [data folder](data/).

An extracted list of warnings and corresponding sections/components can be found in [warnings.csv](data/warnings.csv).
Please, not that the extracted list might be not complete why it might be worth to inspect the manual artifacts directly.

Detailed guidelines for the competition are available in [GUIDELINES](documentation/GUIDELINES.md).

Installation instructions of how to use the code can be found in [INSTALLATION](documentation/INSTALLATION.md).


## Evaluation

Published methodology and benchmark context are collected in
[Competition results and research context](documentation/RESULTS_AND_RESEARCH_CONTEXT.md).

The competition evaluates warning omissions, warning coverage, failure-input
diversity, and time to the first failure across repeated runs. The complete
metric definitions and evaluation rules are maintained in the
[competition guidelines](documentation/GUIDELINES.md).
